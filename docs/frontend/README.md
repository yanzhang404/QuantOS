# Frontend

The first read-only research workspace is implemented in `apps/web`. It exposes
the actual Donchian ATR study as an interactive strategy comparison:

- BTC/ETH and development/evaluation switching;
- returns, Sharpe, drawdown, trades, fills, and fees;
- Buy & Hold, EMA, and Donchian ATR comparison;
- doubled-cost evaluation stress;
- research findings and immutable dataset/Run IDs.

The workspace imports the committed structured result artifact at build time.
The next frontend boundary is a versioned read-only API for browsing multiple
datasets, runs, and studies. Live trading and order actions remain disabled.
